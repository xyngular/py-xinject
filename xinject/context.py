Manage shared dependency and dependency injection.


# To Do First:

If you have not already, to get a nice high-level overview of library see either:

- project README.md here:
    - https://github.com/xyngular/py-xinject#documentation
- Or go to xinject module documentation at here:
    - [xinject, How To Use](./#how-to-use)


# Quick Start

## Please Read First

If your looking for a simple example/use of singltone-like dependencies,
go to `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared dependencies.

Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

Most of the time a dependency will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
dependency of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

So normally, code would do this to get the current object instance for a Resource:

>>> class SomeResource(Dependency):
>>>    my_attribute = "default-value"
>>>
>>> # Normally code would do this to interact with current Dependency subclass object:
>>> SomeResource.grab().my_attribute = "change-value"

Another convenient way to get the current dependency is via the
`xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
and use it directly.

I would start with [Fundamentals](#fundamentals) if you know nothing of how
`xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
`xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familiar with Context is more about
utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

.. important:: The below is for advanced use-cases and understanding.
    Look at `xinject.dependency.Dependency` or docs just above ^^^ for the normal use-case and
    examples / quick starts.

# Context Overview

Context is used to keep track of a set of dependencies. The dependencies are keyed off the class
type. IE: One dependency per-context per-dependency-type.

Main Classes:

- `xinject.context.XContext`: Container of dependencies, mapped by type.
- For Resource Subclasses:
    - `xinject.dependency.Dependency`: Nice interface to easily get the current dependency.
        Used to implment a something that should be shared and not generally duplicated,
        like a soft-singleton.

# Fundamentals

`xinject.context.XContext` is like a container, used to store various objects we are calling
dependencies.

Used to store various dependencies of any type  in general [ie: configs, auths, clients, etc].
All of these dependencies together represent a sort of "context" from which various pieces of code
can easily get them; that way they can 'share' the dependency when appropriate. This is a way
to do dependcy injection in a easier and more reliable way since you don't have to worry
about passing these dependencies around everywhere manually.

The values are mapped by their type.  When a dependency of a specific type is asked for,
the Context will return it if it finds it. If not found it will create it, add it to its self
and return it. Future calls will return this new dependency.

`xinject.context.XContext` can optionally have a parent. By default, a newly created/used Context
will use the current context Normally, dependencies are still normally created even if a
parent has a value, as long as the current context does not have one yet.

This behavior can be customized by the dependency, see one of these for details:

- `xinject.dependency.Dependency`
    - Useful for a shared/soft overridable shared object; where you can easily get the current
        version of it.


## Dependencies
[dependencies]: #dependencies

There are various ways to get dependencies from the current context. Let's say we have
a dependency called `SomeResourceType`:

>>> next_identifier = 0
>>> class SomeResourceType(Dependency):
...     def __init__(self):
...         global next_identifier
...         self.some_value = "hello!"
...         self.ident = next_identifier
...         next_identifier += 1

.. note:: SomeResourceType's `ident` field gets incremented and set on each newly created object.
    So the first SomeResoureType's `ident` will equal `0`,
    the second one created will be `1` and so forth.

If what you want inherits from `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, it has a nice class method that
returns the current dependency.
The easiest way to get the current dependency for the type in this case is
to call `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` on it's type like so:

>>> SomeResourceType.grab().some_value
'hello!'
>>> SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0

When a Context does not have the dependency, by default it will create it for you, as you
saw in the previous example.

`XContext.current()` will return the current Context if no params are passed in, or if a
type is passed in, it will return the current Context's dependency for the passed in type.

This means another way to grab dependencies is to get the current `XContext.current`,
and then ask it for the dependency like below. This works for any type, including
types that don't inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency`:

>>> XContext.grab().grab(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'

If you pass a type into `XContext.current`, it will do the above ^ for you:

>>> XContext.current(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'
>>> XContext.current(SomeResourceType).ident
0

As you can see, it still returns the same object [ie: `ident == 0`]

## Activating New Resource

You can easily create a new dependency, configure it however you like and then 'activate' it,
so it's the current version of that dependency. This allows you to 'override' and activate your
own copy of a dependency.

You can do it via one of the below listed methods/examples below.

For these examples, say I have this dependency defined:

>>> from dataclasses import dataclass
>>> from xinject import Dependency
>>>
>>> @dataclass
>>> class MyResource(Dependency):
>>>     some_value = 'default-value'
>>>
>>> assert MyResource.grab().some_value == 'default-value'

- Use desired `xinject.dependency.Dependency` subclass as a method decorator:

        >>> @MyResource(some_value='new-value')
        >>> def my_method():
        >>>     assert MyResource.grab().some_value == 'new-value'

## Activating New Context

When you create a new context, you can activate it to make it the current context in four ways
(listed below).

1. Via the `with` statement.
2. As a method dectorator, ie: `@`.
3. Using `with` or `@` for a `xinject.dependency.Dependency`,
    that will create and activate a new `UContext` with the newley activated dependency in it.
3. When running a unit-test where xinject is installed as a dependency,
    because the `xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context` fixture is auto-used in this case.
    This fixture creates a new `UContext with a `None` parent;
    that will isolate dependencies between each run of a unit test method.

### Examples

Here are examples of the four ways to create/activate a new context:

>>> with XContext():
...     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
1

This is stack-able as well; as in this can keep track of a stack of contexts, in a
thread-safe way.

When the context manager or decorated method is exited, it will pop-off the context,
and it won't
be the default one anymore. Whatever the default one was before you entered the `with` will
be the default once more.

>>> @XContext():
>>> def a_decorated_method():
...     return SomeResourceType.grab().ident
>>> a_decorated_method()
2
>>> a_decorated_method()
3
>>> SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0

As you can see, after the method exits the old context takes over, and it already had the
older version of the dependency and so returns that one.

By default, a context will create a dependency when it's asked for it, and it does not have it
already. As you saw above, every time a blank Context was created, it also created a new
SomeResourceType when it was asked for it because the new blank `xinject.context.XContext`
did not already have the dependency.


>>> with XContext():
>>>     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
4

There is a pytest plugin with an auto-use fixture that will create brand-new app + thread root
UContext's; so that each unit test function run will start with no dependecies from other tests.

>>> def test_some_text(context):
...    # This is guaranteed to be a newly created `SomeResourceType`.
...    SomeResourceType.grab()



There are ways to share dependency in a parent Context that a new blank context would beable
to use. But that's more advanced usage. The above should be enough to get you started quickly.
See below for more advanced usage patterns.

# Parents

A Context can have a parent (`XContext.parent`) or event a chain of them (`XContext.parent_chain`)

Because it's the safest thing to do by default for naive dependencies, Context's normally don't
consult parents for basic dependencies, they will just create them if they don't already have them.

You can customize this behavior. There are some default dependency base classes that will implment
a few common patterns for you. You can see how they work to get ideas, and customize the process
for your own dependency when needed. See [Resource Base Classes][dependency-base-classes] below for
more details on how to do that.

You can make an isolated Context by doing:

>>> XContext(parent=None)

When creating a new context. This will tell the context NOT to use a parent. By default, a
Context will use the current Context as the time the Context was created as it's parent.
See `XContext.parent` for more details.

This is also how the Context test fixture works (see `xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context`).
It creates a new parent-less context and activates it while the fixture is used.

# Resource Base Classes
[dependency-base-classes]: #dependency-base-classes.

### `xinject.dependency.Dependency`

You can implment the singleton-pattern easily by inherting from the
`xinject.dependency.Dependency` class.
This will try it's best to ensure only one dependency is used amoung a chain/tree of parents.
It does this by returning `self` when `xinject.context.XContext` asks it what it wants to do when
a child-context asks for the dependency of a specific type.

Since `xinject.dependency.Dependency` can be shared amoung many diffrent child Context objects,
and makes the same instance always 'look' like it's the current one;
generally only one is every made or used.

However, you can create a new Context, make it current and put a diffrent instance of the
dependency in it to 'override' this behavior.
See [Activating New Resource](#activating-new-dependency) for more details.

#### Example

I create a new class that uses our previous [SomeResourceType][dependencies] but adds in a
`xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

>>> class MySingleton(SomeResourceType, Dependency):
...     pass
>>> MySingleton.grab().ident
5

Now watch as I do this:

>>> with XContext():
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
5

The same dependency is kept when making a child-context. However, if you make a parent-less
context:

>>> with XContext(parent=None):
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
6

The `xinject.dependency.Dependency` will not see pased the parent-less context,
and so won't see the old dependency.
It will create a new one. The `xinject.dependency.Dependency` will still create it in the
furtherest parent it can... which in this case was the `xinject.context.XContext` activated by the
with statement.

                parent.

                Right now the only valid option is to do one of these three options:

                - nothing (ie: leave at `xsentinels.default.Default`): If left as
                    `xsentinels.default.Default`, We lookup current context and use that as the
                    parent in self and in copies or when self is used in a `with` statement or as
                    a decorator.
                - Pass `None`, indicating to not use any parent for current thread,
                    even if copied or used in a decorator/with-statement.
                    This means app-root, and any current thread-root will be ignored.
                - Pass `_TreatAsRootParent`, indicating to not use any parent, but allow copies
                    or when used as decorator/with-statement to use the currently activate
                    XContext as the new copies parent.

                    This option should **ONLY** be used internally in this module.

                    If you use `_TreatAsRootParent` as the value, keep in mind that a root-like
                    XContext is special, as it never has a parent and is also considered to have
                    a default parent if it's copied. A context is shallow copied, and the copy
                    activated when used as a decorator or in a `with` statement.

                    `_TreatAsRootParent ` should only be used INTERNALLY in this module,
                    it's not currently exposed publicly.

                    See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on root-like contexts.

            name (str): Optional name.
                If left as None, by default, this will simply assign a unique sequential
                number to the name.

                If name is passed in, it will be appended to the unique sequential number.

                When XContext is printed in a string, it will include
                this as it's name to make debugging easier.

        ## Summary

        The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared
        dependencies. This method is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet
        directly.

        Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

        Normally a resource will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
        class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
        resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

        So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

        >>> class SomeResource(Dependency):
        >>>    pass
        >>> # Normally code would do this to get current Dependency object:
        >>> SomeResource.grab()

        Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
        `xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
        that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
        So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
        and use it directly.

        I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how
        `xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

        Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
        utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

        ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

        You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize dependencies. When the context is
        thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
        resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

        You can inject/replace dependencies as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
        adding the resource to a new/blank `xinject.context.XContext` as a diffrent type,
        see example below.

        In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
        I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
        custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
        the normal code asks for.

        >>> XContext().add(20, for_type=str)
        >>> XContext().dependency(str)
        Output: 20

        ## Specific Details

        Given a type of `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, or any other type;
        we will return an instance of it.

        If we currently don't have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
        We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

        You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

        Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

        If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
        that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
        yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
        class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
        check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

        Args:
            for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
                this type will be returned.

            create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
                If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
                If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.
